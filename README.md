## Preprocessing:
Corrected the "Height" column by replacing it with random values between 150 cm and 180 cm to maintain consistency.

## Analysis Tasks:
* Team distribution and percentage split.
* Employee segregation by position.
* Identification of the predominant age group.
* Team and position with the highest salary expenditure.
* Correlation between age and salary.

## Graphical Representations:
Visuals for team distribution, position segregation, age groups, salary expenditures, and the age-salary correlation.

## Insights:
Key trends and patterns observed regarding team structures, salary investments, and the distribution of employees by age and position.

* Team Distribution: The graph clearly depicts that the team "New Orleans Pelicans" has the highest number of players. Both "Orlando Magic" and "Minnesota Timberwolves" contributes for the lowest number of employees.
* Position Segregation: The most number of employees come under "SG" and least under "C".
* Predominant Age Group: The dataset shows the majority of employees are in a specific age range (25-30), possibly indicating a preference for younger talent.
* Highest Salary Expenditure: The team "Los Angeles Lakers" has the highest salary expenditure.
* Age and Salary Correlation: A correlation of 0.214 indicates a weak positive correlation between age and salary. This means that there is a slight tendency for salary to increase as age increases, the relationship is not very strong.

## Conclusion:

The analysis shows that most employees are concentrated in the 25-30 age group, indicating a focus on younger talent. Certain teams and positions have the highest salary expenditure, suggesting strategic investments in key roles. There is a weak positive correlation between age and salary, meaning salary increases slightly with age, but other factors like performance and position likely play a bigger role in salary determination. Overall, the organization prioritizes specific positions and age ranges while strategically distributing its salary budget.
